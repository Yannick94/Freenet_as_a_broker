\subsection{Goal Definitions}
In this section, the goals of the bachelor thesis are defined, which are to be achieved, in addition, some optional goals are defined, which can be added as extensions if there is enough time. 
These are the "must" goals:
\begin{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item
The exchange of data should be largely anonymous. It should not be possible to know the data is being uploaded and who has read it. 
\item
The exchange of data must be protected and data must only be readable by authorized persons / hardware.  
\item
The data access should only be known to the authorized parties.  
\item
Document architecture and encryption.
\item
Implement the documented architecture and encryption in a prototype.
\item
Encryption and signing of the data using elliptic curves. If possible using elliptic curves, if not possible use AES / RSA.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

These are the "optional" goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The security-relevant functions of Freenet should be used in the best possible way.
