Freenet as a Broker for IoT Data

At the moment, IoT devices are heavily dependent on the respective manufacturers. If the manufacturer of a device goes bankrupt, the IoT devices developed and sold by him also become useless. Since most of the data exchange takes place via the manufacturer.

We want to start with exactly this problem and break the dependency of the IoT devices on the manufacturer.

But how do we do it?

We are creating a new way of communication via Freenet, an open source anonymously file sharing platform.

Our IoT device on the patient's premises measures their values.
The values ​​are encrypted by the IoT device and sent to Freenet, our broker.

Freenet saves this data.

This data is then picked up by our recipients, be it other IoT devices or computers.

After this data has been collected, it will be decrypted and made available to the Medical Staff.

With the help of this communication, we can break the dependency on the manufacturer and enable the IoT devices to continue to be used even if the manufacturer goes bankrupt.
