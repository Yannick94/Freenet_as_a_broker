\section{Attacks an Prevention}
The following chapter describes various possible attack scenarios and the possible solutions to prevent them. 
The following attacks are considered: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Spoffing of Source of data}
    \SubItem{The information that is stored on the broker can be changed or overwritten by anyone who knows the data.

    \SubItem{}
    \item{Interruption of the data flow by flooding Freenet}
        \SubItem{The behavior with regard to packet loss and the availability of the broker (Freenet) must be tested and examined under high loads. }
\end{itemize}
