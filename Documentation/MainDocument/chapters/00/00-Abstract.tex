This paper is the product of the module "Bachelor Thesis" at the Bern University of Applied Sciences. The task was to create a new way of communication between IoT devices, so that independence from hardware manufacturers is achieved. The new communication option created in this way is to be implemented on the basis of a prototype with the help of Arduino Uno Wifi rev3.
