The goal of this thesis is to design the communication of IoT data independently from the manufacturer via a new communication path. The requirements for this new communication path are the anonymity of the transmitted data, i.e. it should not be known from whom the data originates or who has received this data. Furthermore, the data that is transmitted should also be encrypted. This prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading the data. 
To meet these requirements, a new broker (data intermediary) was established with Freenet, which replaces the manufacturer as broker. In addition, a prototype was created that uses this new communication path to exchange data. This performs an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellmann Key Exchange to encrypt the data. 
This prototype has shown us that it is possible to replace the manufacturer of the IoT data as a broker and to ensure independence from the manufacturer. Thus, it is possible to enable a more sustainable use of IoT devices.
