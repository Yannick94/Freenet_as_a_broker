\section{Planing Methode}
For the planning of my bachelor thesis, I referred to the well-known project management method, the waterfall model. The waterfall model is a classic project management model that consists of successive phases. In contrast to agile project management models, each individual phase must be completed before the next one begins, since the individual phases build on each other. 
Although this project planning method has some disadvantages, the advantages outweigh them.
It allows you to better structure the work. Since phase after phase must be completed. It provides easy tracking, this because a waterfall model can be easily read and developed by all stakeholders without special certification or training.
The main disadvantage of the waterfall model is that it is difficult to make changes during the process. However, since the requirements and goals are already defined at the start of my bachelor thesis, the likelihood of changes during the process is negligible. 
\newline
On the next page you will find the waterfall model of my bachelor thesis. This was divided into 5 phases. Planning, Preparation, Documentation, Realization, Finalization.
Each of these phases has at least 1 milestone, which marks the end of the respective phase and at the same time the transition to the next phase.
